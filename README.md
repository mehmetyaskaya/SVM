# SVM

This repository includes the implementation and analysis of Support Vector Machines (SVM) applied on a non-linearly separable dataset. Linear, Polynomial, and RBF kernels were used and their performances were compared. The RBF kernel was selected as the best performing model based on classification results.

All code, figures, and report are included.
